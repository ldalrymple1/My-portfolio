    <!-- ABOUT ME  -->
    <section class="about">
      <div class="blurb-wrapper">
          <p class="blurb">While studying Modern Languages at university, I became particularly interested in the logic and
              structure of language. Determined to pursue this interest further, I enrolled on the Software
              Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly. I found programming languages not only
              addictive but stimulating. They allow more room for creativity and overcoming the challenges they
              present has become a hobby that I would feel privileged to do every day as a career. As a quick
              learner who thrives in a fast-paced environment, I am excited to stretch my abilities and learn more
              about the languages of modern technology.</p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>Determined to stretch myself, I built a Full-Stack application which was rooted in a Python and PostgreSQL back-end. Aimed at art enthusiasts, it allows users to browse upcoming art exhibitions in London. This was my first project working with Python and I was really satisfied with the finished product. Users can view the exhibitions in a traditional card view and map view; however, in due course I plan to add calendar view as well as other features.</p>

        <div class="text">

        <p>We were given a week to build a Full Stack MERN application. With only one weeks tuition in node.js and Express, I undertook the challenge of being responsible for developing the back-end. As aspiring developers, we decided to build a skill-swapping, community-led platform for junior developers. We built our own RESTful API as well as using a third-party API. This project taught me the benefits of favouring refactoring and bug fixing to ensure readable and maintainable code, imperative when sharing codebases. </p>

        <div class="text">

          <p>As a pair we were built a React.js app using a third-party API. My partner and I shared a mutual interest in film, so we decided to use the MovieDB to build a website to help users choose a film. Working against the clock with just a 48-hour deadline, this project highlighted the importance of outlining and achieving a minimum viable product (MVP). I really enjoyed working in a pair and learnt some invaluable techniques from my partner.</p>

        <p>I had one week to develop a grid-based game.Â  This was my first proper project using JavaScript. It proved to be a steep learning curve but it was a hugely satisfying experience and showed how much I had learnt in a short space of time. The end product was a Shrek themed version of the traditional game 'Frogger'.</p>
